              New cryptocurrency projects can be submitted through our Submit
              Token form. Once your project is successfully submitted, it will
              appear under the "NEW COINS" tab on our homepage, allowing the
              community to start voting. These votes are crucial to the
              project's success; higher vote counts lead to better rankings on
              our site, increasing visibility.
              <br />
              <br />
              We review new projects daily and will reach out to the token owner
              if any issues arise. Our dedicated support team monitors updates
              around the clock, 24/7, and is always available to assist with any
              questions you may have.
